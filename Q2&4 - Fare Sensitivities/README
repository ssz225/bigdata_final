We first setup a Spark Cluster on AWS EMR.  We followed the directions at 

https://aws.amazon.com/articles/Elastic-MapReduce/4926593393724923

After ssh into the master node, we pasted spark_reg.py in a new file.

We ran our script with

MASTER=yarn-client /home/hadoop/spark/bin/pyspark spark_reg.py

We then waited many hours to come back for the regression outputs from terminal.

We saved these terminal outputs to a text file. These are what we used for Question 4 (printed to std out).

We then analyze the outputs, spark-output.txt for 2010 to produce outputs for the remainder of Question 2.
